Full simulation experiment 
===============

This repository contains an implementation of the FairTrade method and black-box evaluation technique, 
applied in a full simulation experiment, and code for the corresponding experiments in 'Causality-based Fairness using Variational Inference'. 


## Usage
- Use simulation.py for simulating the data and training a CEVAE model
- Use intervention_experiment.py to check correctness of interventional distribution
- Use eval_experiment.py for the black-box evaluation results
