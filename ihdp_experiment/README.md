IHDP experiment 
===============

This repository contains an implementation of the FairTrade method, applied for the IHDP dataset, 
and code for the corresponding experiments in 'Causality-based Fairness using Variational Inference'. 

This Python3 PyTorch implementation is based on the Python2 TensorFlow (+Edward) implementation that can be found here: https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/CEVAE

## Usage

- Train the Causal effect model using main.py
- Create models counterfactually fair models using create_cfm.py
